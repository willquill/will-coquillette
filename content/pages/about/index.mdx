### Hey, my name is Will. I do DevOps.

I've been fascinated by computers since my dad taught me how to launch games with DOS commands in 1991.

After mastering Windows 3.11, I moved onto...actually, let me skip ahead.

For the past few years, I've been using Python and Javascript to facilitate event management for a Security Operations Center.

I've been using these tools extensively:

- Terraform
  - AWS deployment (VPC, EKS, EC2, Route53, RDS, Elasticache, and more)
  - I know modules in and out, remote modules, local modules, nested modules, git modules, inputs, outputs, everything!
- Kubernetes
- Elasticsearch
  - Lots of API usage to manage and manipulate data
  - I've done a lot with ingestion, queries, mapping, templates, reindexing, analysis, searching, and more
- ServiceNow (including quite a bit of scripting within the platform)
- StreamSets
- Python
- Javascript
- WSL
- VSCode

#### Cyber Threat Intelligence

Prior to my current DevOps role, I was the Cyber Threat Intelligence Engineer at H&R Block, and my primary role was to engineer the organization's response to risk by analyzing the threat landscape and preparing appropriate prevention measures as well as to design the response for various scenarios.

My specialties were:

- Juniper SRX/EX (with some MX here and there)
- Pulse Secure VPN
- Palo Alto Networks firewalls
